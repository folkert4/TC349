		<h1>Card Sorting NASA's "Moon" website</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;margin:5px;">Findings</h2>
		<p>I used the average of the the card sortings, ties were decided by my choice</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Main Headings</td>
				<td>Minor Headings</td>
				<td>minor subheadings</td>
				<td>minor pages</td>

			This sort is obviously much different from the current site and I think that there are several reaosns for that. One of the main reasons is that the people doing this sort, including me, do not have much knowledge of the moon or anything about it. This why many of the main and minor headings on the site as they are, were changed to more generic heaidngs. This will allow more novice space enthusiasts to delve deeper without feeling lost. Another main example is how far deep we all pushed some of the information. The page as it is feels quite cluttered and this invokes an uncomfortable feeling in the user and makes them simply want to click back and find an easier site to find information on.<br />
			All sorters agreed that the current homepage and coloring scheme was too 'busy', but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. We also agreed that the about moon section was over-full and could be structured much better, as shown in our sorts.<br />
